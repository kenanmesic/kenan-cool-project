Have an idea (take the gif idea)  --> look for examples 

- Sketch rough picture of the layout (What should we include?)
    - About Me 
    - Section with of our projects
    - Contacts (links to your linked or social)
    - Header
    - Naviagation
    - Footer


- Think about the structure 
    - wireframing --> Think of your sections as lego blocks or "containers"
    - think about putting lick content together in containers or <sections>

    <section class="aboutMe">
        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>Click Here </li>

        </ul>
    </section>


-  Top to Bottom Style

        - Header
        - Naviagation
        - About Me
        - Projects
        - Footer



- Keep in mind HTML element block vs inline vs inline-block
